    "hook": "It is the last Friday of October 2022. Bharatvarsh stands in the glow of its annual festive fortnight—until twenty bombs detonate in ten minutes.",
    "description": "In the capital city of Lakshmanpur, crowds fill the streets for the final night of celebrations. Vendors showcase the latest tech—glide-cars floating five meters above traffic, 3D printers producing organic food, AR goggles and Brace-Comms projecting holographic interfaces. Army personnel patrol with hovercams sweeping overhead. Beneath the festivities, the Mesh watches everything. Perfect order. Perfect control. Until it shatters.",
    "plot": "On a festive stage, a band calling themselves The Tribhuj—a terrorist organization thought extinct for decades—declares war on the military regime. Moments later, explosives tear through the arena. Across Bharatvarsh, synchronized attacks strike twenty locations in ten minutes. Meanwhile, in the ink-black Himalayan hills, a convoy carrying the East's most important figure is ambushed. A woman named Kaali fights to survive as rockets and bullets find their marks.",
    "stakes": "Kahaan, a military prince born to privilege and trained for duty, is assigned to investigate the 20-10 bombings. What begins as hunting terrorists becomes something far more dangerous—a journey that will force him to cross boundaries of nations and generations, uncovering deep dark secrets about the military and himself. Some secrets are buried so deep they've become foundations. Exposing them might bring justice—or collapse everything the nation was built upon.",
    "closing": "When the price of Harmony is paid by Freedom."
