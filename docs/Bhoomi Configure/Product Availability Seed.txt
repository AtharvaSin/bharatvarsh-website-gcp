## 5) Operational rules for your team (so catalog stays accurate)

1) Only move an item from “In Development” → “Available Now” when:
   - at least one live purchase link exists, AND
   - the item is announced on the website/forum announcements.
2) Keep purchase URLs in one place (this doc) and reuse everywhere (site pages, chatbot KB, marketing posts).
3) Avoid promising dates. Use “In Development / Planned” until official announcements.
